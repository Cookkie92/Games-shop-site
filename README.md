# Description
Add a more detailed description of what your project entails and set out to do.

For this project i set out to create a good looking and responsive website for buying and selling games.
This website's demographic is of course gamer dudes/girls age 16-30 so i designed it in a way i tought would catch their eyes.

The games on the site are just made up by me for now, but i will be connecting to an API eventually to get some real games showing.
